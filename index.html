								<h4>The College Dropout</h4>
								<p>One of the iconic images of Kanye's entire career is the Dropout Bear. Kanye was adamant about not having his face or any writing on the cover of The College Dropout, so he appeared dressed as the Dropout Bear mascot.<br><br> <i>"The bear just happened to be at the school where Def Jam had booked the photo shoot for the album," - Plain Pat</i></p>

								<h4>Late Registration</h4>
								<p>"Gold Digger" wasn’t meant to be a Kanye West song. It was originally created for Shawnna's 2004 debut album Worth Tha Weight. For whatever reason, she passed on the beat and Kanye rewrote the hook (which originally went "I ain't saying I'm a gold digger/But I ain't messing with no broke n***a") from a female perspective to a male one. The song reached No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 chart and stayed there for 10 weeks. It remains Kanye's biggest hit to date.</p>

								<h4>Graduation</h4>
								<p>Kanye is noted for his fashion sense, having owned a clothing line and started off many fashion trends around the world, even inspiring the pioneer of crazy fashion himself, Michael Jackson, who apparently phoned him up to ask about the jacket he wore in the music video for 'Stronger'. <br><br>That song, 'Stronger', famously used a sample of Daft Punk's 'Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger'.</p>

								<h4 class="cardFaceAlt">808s & Heartbreak</h4>
								<p class="cardFaceAlt">Kanye West's fourth album '808s & Heartbreak' has been crowned one of the most groundbreaking albums of all time by Rolling Stone magazine.<br><br><i>"Kanye West's Auto-Tune-heavy, emotionally naked fourth album came after a brutal year during which his mother died and his engagement broke up, but the album's cavernous sound and exposed-soul lyrics confused even those who had been aware of West's recent trials." - Rolling Stone</i></p>

								<h4>My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy</h4>
								<p>On <i>Fantasy</i>, Kanye gets ridiculously maximal, blowing past all the rules of hip-hop and pop, even though, for the past half-decade, he's been the one inventing the rules. There are hip-hop epics, R&B ballads, alien electronics, prog-rock samples, surprise guests from Bon Iver to Fergie to Chris Rock, even a freaking Elton John piano solo. It's his best album, but it's more than that - it's also a rock-star manifesto for a downsizing world.</p>

								<h4>Watch the Throne</h4>
								<p>Expanding on the dense production style of West's 2010 album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy, Watch the Throne incorporates orchestral and progressive rock influences, unconventional samples, and dramatic melodies in its sound. Jay-Z and West's braggadocio lyrics exhibit themes of opulence, fame, materialism, power, and the burdens of success, as well as political and socioeconomic context.</p>

							</div>
							<div class="cardFace back">
								<h4>Yeezus</h4>
								<p>Yeezus is the culmination of the movement that began with 2008’s equally-divisive 808s and Heartbreaks. That album marked a shift in Kanye’s work from the radio-friendly hitmaking that defined his first three albums to something more experimental and ambitious, from that album’s bleak, Autotuned melancholia to the decadent grandiosity of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy.</p>

							<div class="cardFace back">
								<h4>The Life of Pablo</h4>
								<p><i>"The world has distracted from Kanye West's creative process - except, as he shows on The Life of Pablo, distraction is his creative process. This is a messy album that feels like it was made that way on purpose, after the laser-sharp intensity of Yeezus.<br><br>West just drops broken pieces of his psyche all over the album and challenges you to fit them together."</i> - Rolling Stone</p>
